										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1>3 Qualities of an Excellent Security Guard</h1>
<p>As an owner of any category business, your first instinct is to invest in a technologically <a href="https://svrsecuritysolutions.com/">advanced security solutions</a> as an unbeatable defense mechanism. However, the human factor in a security system remains indispensable. The standard of security is only achievable by a human security guard who works as a consciously active security system with the benefit of making decisions according to the situation.</p>
<p>A security guard is responsible for protecting your property/ building/ business and preventing any damage and threat possessed by the society including scenarios of violent protests in extreme cases. A security guard will also manage your security system technicalities.</p>
<p>Being a security guard is a tough job and requires exceptional personality traits such as steadiness, confidence, flexibility etc. some of the qualities that make an individual and excellent security would include</p>
<h3></h3>
<h3>Mental Attributes:</h3>
<p>Mental attributes refer to the strong cognitive processes of the mind. In the career of a security guard, mental steadiness is as important as physical. An excellent security guard has sharp sense and the ability to strategize action-based solutions quickly.</p>
<p>A security guard should be able to handle stressful situations without apparent bluffing and make rational decisions in the favor of the employer&#8217;s benefit and safety. The ability to make a good decision should be objective and not hasty.</p>
<p>Some other important mental traits include:</p>
<p>• Observation<br />
• Good judgment skills<br />
• Multitasking<br />
• Honestly and integrity<br />
• Time punctual in management<br />
• Organized<br />
• Good memory (ability to recognize unusual behavior and patterns)<br />
• Ability to work in a team<br />
• Leadership skills<br />
• Cool temperament.</p>
<p>Another often required skill of a security guard is report writing. It may not be a lesson from your training but certain companies require you to submit a weekly or monthly written report with all the details of the parameters and security systems</p>
<h3>Physical Fitness:</h3>
<p>The job of a security guard is fairly risky and requires a healthy body and fitness. For a security guard, physical fitness should mean the physical capacity of tolerating a hectic day that includes hours of standing indoor and outdoor, strong muscles to avoid spasms, good runner and strength to stop certain kind threads.</p>
<p>Physical fitness is also important because body steadiness plays a role of defense in extraordinary situations. For a security guard, physical fitness also includes eye and hand coordination and the ability to move quickly while handling a weapon. Although the use of weapons is rare, it remains a requirement.</p>
<h3>Attitude and Quick Response:</h3>
<p>The attitude of a security guard creates the first impression for the audience/ strangers.<br />
A security guard with a sharp attitude is still required to appear respectful and approachable.<br />
Along with a sharp look, a security guard should be excellent and calm communicators.<br />
Clear communication is key in all professional fields. However, it is viable and important in the career of a security guard. Communication is the first line of defense for a security guard and also a non-invasive weapon from keeping the situation from escalating.</p>
<h3>Overview:</h3>
<p>A technological security system only helps you record the situations all around without employing too many individuals but a security guard is important to handle situations first hand. An excellent security guard should be mentally and physically sharp with ratio and quick responses to prevent any threats.</p>
